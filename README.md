TIC TAC TOE AI using Python and Pygame
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent. The game is built using Python and Pygame library for the graphical user interface. You can play against another player or against an AI that uses the minimax algorithm to make decisions.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Pygame library

How to Play
Run the script using Python.
The game starts in Player vs Player (PvP) mode by default.
Press 'g' to switch between Player vs Player (PvP) and Player vs AI (PvAI) modes.
Press '0' to switch the AI to random mode (easy difficulty) or '1' to switch to minimax mode (hard difficulty).
Click on an empty square to make a move. The first player (X) starts the game.
The game ends when a player wins, or there's a draw.
Press 'r' to reset the game at any time.

Features
Two game modes: Player vs Player (PvP) and Player vs AI (PvAI).
AI uses the minimax algorithm to make intelligent decisions (hard difficulty).
AI can also be set to random mode for easier gameplay.
Simple and intuitive graphical user interface using Pygame.

Acknowledgments
This project is inspired by various Tic Tac Toe implementations available online. Special thanks to the Pygame community for providing an excellent library to create the graphical user interface.

I have created this project for learning python(numpy,gamepy,OOPS concepts) and Ai(minmax algorithm) inspired by a Youtube Tutorial of Coding Spot.
